The AI-generated captions featured in this Instagram Clone project are not derived from any specific dataset. Due to the lack of suitable publicly available datasets on platforms like Kaggle or other sources, the captions were manually curated by me from common expressions and publicly available content on the internet.

The primary objective of this feature is to demonstrate the potential for AI-driven content enhancement in social platforms, showcasing how mood-based caption suggestions can be integrated into user experience.

This implementation serves as a prototype to highlight the feature's feasibility. In the future, improvements such as:

Integrating with fine-tuned natural language models,

Using mood-based sentiment analysis, or

Leveraging larger datasets for training

can help enhance the accuracy, variety, and contextual relevance of generated captions, resulting in a smoother and more personalized experience for users.


Note: This project was built within 2 days for a hackathon. Some features may not be fully functional or stable yet.
 Thank you for your understanding and support!
